## Chicago Ruby Hack Night December 2019: Traveling Santa

It's been been a rough year and only a handful of American cities have
any children making the "nice" list.

We have a [list of cities and their coordinates](nice-kid-cities.csv)
and want to figure out a route that gets things over for Santa quickly and
efficiently, starting and ending at his house at the north pole.

These libraries might be helpful:
